The last sheet in the schematic is the amplifier 8x 

vin+  is the + of the amplifier , but the signal is negative
vout+ corresponse with vin+  so this has to connected to the ADC board Vin- pin 

resistors are 805 size because these I have 
for the final layout 603 is possible.
Smaller values will be a problem because we need precision. 
Also the cost of the resitors is big  on average > 0.2 Euro  for the matched resistors. 
No solution to match the capacitors.But these are not so critical except the integration resistor. 


Output order of channels is not as input order on the ADC board) 
( so  in 0   doesn't corresponds to in 0 on the ADC board). 
Didn't anticipate to have a socket out. Proposal was a VME kind system. So logic is that the front end card is pins. 
( and the ADC / FPGA card  socket at the left component side and pins at the right component side ) .

Position of the DIN 61412 connector not optimal in respect to ADC board.

Full functionality for the final design as now known. Except the nr of channels.
