The last sheet in the schematic is the amplifier 8x 

vin+  is the + of the amplifier , but the signal is negative
vout+ corresponse with vin+  so this has to connected to the ADC board Vin- pin 

resistors are 805 size because these I have 
for the final layout 603 is possible.
Smaller values will be a problem because we need precision. 
Also the cost of the resitors is big  on average > 0.2 Euro  for the matched resistors. 
No solution to match the capacitors.But these are not so critical except the integration resistor. 


Output order of channels is not as input order on the ADC board) 
( so  in 0   doesn't corresponds to in 0 on the ADC board). 
Didn't anticipate to have a socket out. Proposal was a VME kind system. So logic is that the front end card is pins. 
( and the ADC / FPGA card  socket at the left component side and pins at the right component side ) .

Position of the DIN 61412 connector not optimal in respect to ADC board.

Full functionality for the final design as now known. Except the nr of channels. 



Bugs  :
- no solder resist on middle pad  ADL5317   corrected for this run by PCB manufacure


Improvements / suggestions :
- input filters for the LV power supplies and HV power supply .

for the 10uF use 1206 shape, price consideration.
Use correct symbols for the tantals 

indicate pin 1 for I2c Bus extender in PCB symbol

change bias connector to 3 pins with no middle pin to avoid mixing with the 5 V input. 

Dx:R36 should in principle 470 // 10 K  . But leave it for the moment. Should have minor effect still to be checked for CMMR . 





sernr 1 :
C33, C43 are not matched , not able to measure these  now. 


C35 C45 doesn't  match for the first amplifier 8.

Dx:C31 C41 only 50V ( planned was 100 ) due to wrong order.

C9, C 5  6.8n  , 10n finished ? 

U4  A3 option so  address  A2,A2 = 1,1  so act on 0x7  + Base

R5 mounted so U1 reacts on 0x0 + Base 
R11 not mounted , R12  4.7K  so U2 sould not react on I2C cycles .
